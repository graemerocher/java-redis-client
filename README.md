Simple [Redis][1] client library for Java 6. 

Supports version 2.0.0.

Commands are named according to the [Command Reference][2] even if that is not way methods would be named in Java.
I took the liberty to copy some documentation over, so some parts of the Javadoc are probably copyright (c) 2006-2010,
Salvatore Sanfilippo and other Wiki contributors.

Example usage
-------------
    RedisClient client = new RedisClient("localhost", RedisClient.DEFAULT_PORT);
    try {
      client.set("key", "some value");
      System.out.println(client.get("key"));
    } finally {
      client.close();    
    }

The client is thread-safe as it automatically creates a new connection for a new thread, storing a set of handlers in
a `ThreadLoad` variable.

*PLEASE NOTE:* Redis uses (8-bit clean) byte arrays for keys and values. For convenience, this client uses Strings
instead which are then UTF-8 encoded.

TODO
----
* Add a Maven POM and change package name to something more standard.
* Support binary values, make use of collections
